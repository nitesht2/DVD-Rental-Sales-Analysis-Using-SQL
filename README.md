I used PostgreSQL on the DVD Rental database for analysis. Following task were done during the analysis:

- Used the basics SQL syntax and analyzed data using aggregate functions with GROUP BY commands

- Run advanced queries with string operations and comparison operations

- Used logical operators to add logic flow to SQL queries

- Used common SQL JOIN commands

- Created tables and databases with constraints on data entries

- Used Python to further advanced SQL skills
